You can use IBM® Streams Runner for Apache Beam to execute Apache Beam 2.4 pipelines in an IBM Streams environment. A Beam application that is launched with Streams Runner is translated into a Streams Application Bundle (SAB) file. It is then optionally submitted to an IBM Streaming Analytics service in IBM Cloud or to a running IBM Streams domain and instance.

The [Beam capability matrix](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/) shows the capabilities of the Streams Runner.

For more information about Apache Beam, see the [Apache Beam documentation](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/).
