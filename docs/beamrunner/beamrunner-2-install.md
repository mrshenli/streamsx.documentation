Installing IBM® Streams Runner for Apache Beam involves downloading and extracting the Streams Runner toolkit, configuring environment variables, and creating a credentials file for your Streaming Analytics service. You don't need to install IBM Streams to use Streams Runner.

## Before you start: develop your application
Apache Beam applications can be developed without the Streams Runner being installed. For information about developing your Beam application, see the [Beam SDK for Java](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/java/).

## Choose your Streams environment
A Streams Runner installation is available in IBM Streams installations beginning with v4.3. Additionally, a Streams Runner installation can be downloaded from an IBM Streamign Analytics service on the IBM Cloud.
